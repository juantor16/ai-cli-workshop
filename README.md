1. **AI in the terminal = more power** - Direct access to files, shell, APIs
2. **Context is everything** - The more context you give, the better the output
3. **Iterate, don't expect perfection** - Treat AI as a pair programmer
4. **Anyone can use it** - Not just developers!
5. **Build tools, not just answers** - Create reusable solutions that help your team forever
